**Development Environment and Compilation Guide**

This README file provides information on the development environment and instructions for compiling and running the source code for the Fibonacci sequence generator implemented in C.

**Development Environment:**

To develop and run the Fibonacci sequence generator, you need the following tools installed on your system:

1. C Compiler: The code is written in C, so you'll need a C compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang.

2. Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or an IDE like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Xcode (for macOS) to edit and write the code.

**Compilation:**

Once you have the necessary tools installed, follow these steps to compile the source code:

1. Open a text editor or IDE and create a new file named `fibonacci.c`.

2. Copy the provided C code for the Fibonacci sequence generator into the `fibonacci.c` file.

3. Save the file.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `fibonacci.c` file using the `cd` command.

6. To compile the code using GCC, run the following command:

```
gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c
```

The `-o` flag specifies the output file name, which is `fibonacci`. You can replace `fibonacci` with any desired name for the executable.

**Execution:**

After successfully compiling the source code, follow these steps to run the Fibonacci sequence generator:

1. In the same terminal or command prompt, execute the compiled executable:

```
./fibonacci
```

2. The program will run and display the output, showing the Fibonacci numbers calculated based on the arithmetic operations and conditions defined in the code.

**Example Output:**

```
add : 16
mul : 20
sub : -4
fibo : 2
```

**Cleaning Up:**

If you wish to clean up the generated executable file, you can simply delete it from the directory where it was compiled.

**Note:**

- Make sure you have a C compiler and a suitable text editor or IDE installed on your system before proceeding with the development.

- The provided code assumes that you are using a Unix-like system (e.g., Linux, macOS). If you are using Windows, you can use a terminal emulator like Git Bash or PowerShell to run the commands.

- This README assumes you are familiar with basic C programming concepts and have a basic understanding of using the terminal or command prompt.
